## How It Works

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Pomodonut makes this technique fun with:

- **Work Sessions:** Visualized as a donut being eaten away as time progresses
- **Break Sessions:** Represented by a coffee cup that fills up during your break
- **Visual and Audio Cues:** Notifications when sessions end
- **Session Tracking:** Count how many Pomodoros you've completed

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with animations and responsive design)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- SVG animations
- Local Storage for saving user preferences

## Customization

All settings are saved to your browser's local storage, so your preferences will be remembered between sessions. You can customize:

- Work session duration
- Break duration
- Sound effects and volume
- Auto-start preferences
- Number of Pomodoro sessions
